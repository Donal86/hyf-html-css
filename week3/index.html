                        <img src="images/1.jpg">
                        <p>The Counter Press are a letterpress studio and workshop based in an old chocolate factory in London’s East End, whose folio boasts a gorgeous array of contemporary typographic work. Since launching three years ago the studio has finally found the time to design and produce their very own business cards. The large typography on the back, which is printed in a variety of wood letter faces, beautifully contrasts with the simple front that is elegantly handset in 8pt Plantin. I also love the fluro orange edge painting!</p>

                            <p>Impressive editorial design by London based design consultancy Bibliothèque for The Hour, a watch journal ‘that places emphasis on cerebral content rather than luxury and celebrity’. I particularly love the unconventional masthead, which is cleverly based on the symmetry of a clock face.</p>

                            <p>Love this corporate identity designed by Gerard Marin for Spanish interior designer Neus Ortiz! The centrepiece is the three dimensional ‘N’, which is neatly textured using a variety of geometric patterns to create a dynamic branding system suitable for a range of different applications. When scaled and cropped as seen below the brand mark also functions very nicely as an abstract illustrative element. If you’re a fan I recommend checking out the rest of Marin’s excellent portfolio of work</p>

                            <p>Fuzzco have a slick new website containing a nice array of recent projects that are definitely worth a peek. This charming identity created for Candlefish, a retail store ‘featuring a carefully curated collection of fine candles’, is a personal favourite. It’s hard not to love the quirky, yet elegant Art Deco inspired illustrations and typography! More images after the jump.</p>

                            <img src="images/5.jpg">
                            <p>Territory Studio recently worked with The Wachowski’s to create the screen graphics for their new science fiction action adventure Jupiter Ascending. Using conventions commonly seen in weather maps, they created a series of graphics ‘to articulate various cloaked spaceships and wormhole events’, in addition to other unseen happenings. These stunning graphics were also complemented by a bespoke typeface created by Territory, which coheres with the futuristic aesthetic of these organic visual interpretations. More images and video after the jump.</p>

                            <p>Gorgeous work from the ever-impressive San Francisco based studio Manual, who recently completed this brand identity for Pablo & Rusty’s — ‘an award-winning small-batch coffee roaster’ located in Sydney, Australia. The minimal colour palette and simple use of typography not only reflects Pablo & Rusty’s established brand, but Sydney’s sophisticated yet relaxed café scene too.</p>

                                <p>Impressive editorial work by German studio Deutsche & Japaner, who recently designed this publication chronicling the work of photographer Horst Hamann, who is best known for his black and white photos of New York City’s skyscrapers. The stark black and white colour palette looks great and I particularly love the panoramic fore-edge print and bold typography. Most importantly though the design beautifully compliments Hamann’s own aesthetic and feels right on point.</p>

                            <p>Love this amazing experimental typography by TRIANGLE-STUDIO for the first volume of their self-published design publication. The first volume shown here is dedicated to showcasing their previous typographic work, which can also be viewed on their portfolio site. Definitely worth a look!</p>

                            <p>Beautiful rebrand by Strategy Design & Advertising for Arko (formerly known as Amazing Concrete Generation), which reflects the company’s expanded service offering which now includes landscape architecture and construction. The modernist inspired design and hyper realistic photography feels spot on and the choice of paper stocks and finishing reflects Arko’s high-end portfolio of work. More images after the jump.</p>

                            <p>Australian design studio Toko has just launched a fresh new website that’s definitely worth exploring. The update also includes a swag of new work such this high-end branding for Cult (formerly Corporate Culture), a designer furniture retailer based in Australia and New Zealand.

                        <img src="images/11.jpg">
                        <p>Stunning work from Canadian studio Glasfurd & Walker who recently completed this branding project for Her, Mexico City’s first Blow Dry Bar.
                            I particularly love the logotype, which shouts with grace thanks to the use of high contrast serifs, while the bright red colouring contrasts nicely with the soft pastels seen on the accompanying collateral.
                            This project also serves as a nice example of Glasfurd & Walker’s approach, making the rest of their folio well worth a peek.
